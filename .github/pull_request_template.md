✅ PR CHECKLIST — PRAXIS (MANDATORY)

Every pull request must complete this checklist.
If any item cannot be confidently checked, the PR must not be merged.

🧠 Emotional Safety

This change does not increase emotional demand on a distressed user

This change does not add urgency, motivation, or performance pressure

This change behaves safely if the user feels worse afterward

🔚 Completion & Closure

All affected flows still resolve to one closure state (REST, RELIEF, or READINESS)

No closure language includes praise, success, or future pressure

Silence only occurs after state is named

🧍 Agency & Autonomy

The user can stop early without penalty or friction

No action is implied as required

No new defaults remove user choice

🔁 Failure Modes

This change works if the user:

stops early

repeats the tool frequently

avoids action entirely

returns after relapse

No new shame, evaluation, or comparison is introduced

🧩 Grow Layer Integrity

This change does not announce or measure growth

No scores, streaks, progress indicators, or comparisons were added

Any reflection remains descriptive and optional

💰 Monetization Safety (if applicable)

No monetization appears during tools, closure, or distress

Free users receive identical care and regulation quality

Paid features add context, not pressure

🎨 UI Governance

No progress bars, badges, streaks, or completion checkmarks were added

Stability tools remain visually and behaviorally unchanged

UI remains flat, predictable, and repeatable

🔄 Rollback & Risk

This change can be safely rolled back

Rollback would not strand users mid-flow

No irreversible data or emotional contract changes were introduced

🌙 3AM TEST (FINAL GATE)

If someone opened this at 3am, overwhelmed and alone, nothing would feel louder, newer, or more demanding

✍️ Declaration

I have reviewed this change against GOVERNANCE.md.
If any item above is later found to be violated, this PR should be reverted.
