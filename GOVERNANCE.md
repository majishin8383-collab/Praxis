## Praxis — Emotional Integrity & Evolution Charter

This document defines how Praxis is allowed to change.

It exists to protect emotional safety, user trust, and long-term integrity — even as the product grows, monetizes, or attracts outside pressure.

If this document conflicts with speed, growth, or convenience, **this document wins**.

---

## PRIME GOVERNANCE LAW

> **No change may increase emotional demand on a distressed user.**

If a change makes a user:
- decide more
- do more
- perform better
- understand more
during distress

…it must not ship.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

Praxis is not optimized for:
- engagement
- streaks
- habit formation
- productivity
- performance

Praxis *is* optimized for:
- emotional safety
- agency
- restraint
- predictability
- trust over time

---

## COMPLETION & CLOSURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every user-facing flow **must** end with a closure state.

There are exactly three closure states:
- `REST`
- `RELIEF`
- `READINESS`

Rules:
- One primary state per flow
- Soft-shifts are optional and contextual
- Silence is allowed **only after** state is named
- Closure must return agency and release control

If closure is missing, the implementation is invalid.

---

## VERSIONING PHILOSOPHY

Praxis uses semantic versioning with **emotional meaning**.

### MAJOR (X.0)
Philosophical or architectural change.

May only ship if:
- Emotional contract remains intact
- Closure framework is unchanged or stricter
- No existing tool becomes more demanding
- A rollback plan exists

Major versions should be rare.

---

### MINOR (X.Y)
Optional capabilities added without emotional demand.

Allowed:
- Paid Insight expansion
- Accessibility improvements
- Optional reflection features

Constraints:
- Must be ignorable
- Must not alter default flows
- Must not add steps to existing tools
- Must not change closure behavior

---

### PATCH (X.Y.Z)
Bug fixes and safety improvements.

Includes:
- Language softening
- Pressure removal
- Stability fixes
- Consistency corrections

Patch notes should never include the word “new”.

---

## FEATURE ADMISSION TEST (FAT)

Every proposed feature must answer **yes** to all:

1. Does this reduce harm or pressure?
2. Does it function during failure, not just success?
3. Does it remain valid if the user stops early?
4. Could it exist without being noticed?

If any answer is unclear, the feature does not ship.

---

## GROW LAYER PRESERVATION

Growth in Praxis is a **side-effect**, never a destination.

Forbidden:
- Progress dashboards
- Scores, streaks, or achievements
- Comparative language (past vs present)
- Improvement claims

Allowed:
- Rare, descriptive pattern reflections
- Narrative summaries without evaluation
- Optional insight, never during distress

If growth is announced, it is broken.

---

## MONETIZATION RULES

> **Praxis will never monetize dysregulation.**

### Free Tier
Must always include:
- All Stabilize tools
- All Act tools
- Full closure quality
- Unlimited use
- No degraded language

### Paid Features May Include:
- Pattern reflection
- Personal language adaptation
- Long-horizon narrative context
- Optional reflection space

Paid features must never provide:
- Faster relief
- Deeper safety
- Priority care
- “Advanced” calming

Care is equal for all users.

---

## LANGUAGE GOVERNANCE

### Closure Language Rules
- Present tense
- Descriptive, not evaluative
- Short (≤ 12 words preferred)
- No praise, motivation, or future pressure

Forbidden words (partial matches included):
